Each row of this table represents a model run that the Data Science team has tagged with the metadata key 'run_stage' (initial, intermediate or final, with a suffix denoting the non-demographic variant).

Note that this table is not intended as a tool for data governance.
Schemes and model-relationship managers must keep their own records.
